# Biofeed Production from Urban Food Waste
*(Urban Food Waste → Biofeed | Circular Bioeconomy Project)*

## Overview
This project demonstrates a practical, circular-economy approach to converting post-consumer urban food waste into a stable and nutritionally balanced biofeed suitable for animal consumption. The work focuses on waste valorization, process optimization, and nutrient recovery, with relevance to sustainable feed production and urban waste management.

## Problem Statement
Large volumes of food waste generated from hostels, restaurants, and juice shops are commonly disposed of in landfills, leading to environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, the animal feed industry faces increasing cost and sustainability challenges. This project addresses both issues by transforming mixed urban food waste into value-added biofeed.

## Materials Used
- Cooked rice
- Pulses
- Green peas
- Roti
- Eggshells
- Sugarcane bagasse
- Jaggery (as preservative and binding agent)

## Methodology
- Systematic collection of post-consumer food waste from urban sources
- Segregation, weighing, and hot-air oven drying to reduce moisture and improve shelf life
- Grinding of dried components into fine powders
- Addition of fibre-rich sugarcane bagasse for structural balance
- Preparation of boiled jaggery solution used as a natural preservative and binder
- Pelletization of the mixture followed by controlled re-drying to achieve target moisture levels

## Nutrient Analysis
The formulated biofeed was analyzed using standard biochemical techniques:
- **Protein estimation:** Lowry’s method  
- **Carbohydrate estimation:** Anthrone method  
- **Nitrogen estimation:** Calculated from protein content  

The results indicated improved macro-nutrient concentration compared to raw wet waste, with values falling within basic industry-relevant ranges for animal feed.

## Key Outcomes
- Successful conversion of mixed urban food waste into pelletized biofeed
- Significant moisture reduction, improving stability and storage potential
- Demonstrated feasibility of a low-cost, resource-efficient waste valorization process
- Enhanced nutrient density compared to untreated food waste

## Relevance & Impact
- Reduces landfill disposal of urban food waste
- Contributes to greenhouse gas emission reduction
- Supports circular bioeconomy and sustainable biotechnology practices
- Highlights potential for scalable applications in waste-to-feed systems

## Skills & Concepts Demonstrated
- Industrial microbiology and bioprocess thinking
- Waste valorization and sustainability-driven process design
- Nutrient analysis and data interpretation
- Experimental documentation and reproducibility
